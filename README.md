- 👋 Hi, I’m @josephmangara
- 👀 I’m interested in developing aesthetic and interactive websites powered by powerful self-built APIs. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, mySql, Postgresql, and flask for the backend. I also have experience working with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, bootstrap, and tailwind CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a photo collection API and a website for displaying my work. 
- 📫 You can reach out to me through my email: josephmangara2@gmail.com
